# Challenge_02 Report
## Overview of the Challenge PyRamen:
## Summary:
This Python script is designed to help a ramen shop owner analyze their financial performance by processing menu and sales data. It calculates key metrics for each ramen product, including the quantity sold, revenue, cost of goods sold, and profit. The results are printed to the terminal and saved in a text file for further analysis.
## Methods Used:
The script employs Python and the csv library for data handling. It reads data from CSV files, aggregates per-product metrics, matches sales data with the menu, and prints/writes results.

## Overview of the Challenge PyBank:
This Python script is designed to analyze a financial dataset stored in the "budget_data.csv" file. The dataset contains two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The script's purpose is to calculate and report the following financial metrics:

1) The total number of months included in the dataset.
2) The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3) The average change in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5) The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The results of the analysis will be printed to the terminal, and a text file will be generated with the same information.

## Methods Used:
The script uses a series of Python methods and libraries to accomplish the financial analysis. The following are common methods and libraries that might be used:

* Reading data from a CSV file using the csv library.

* Iterating through the dataset to calculate the required metrics.

* Storing and updating variables to keep track of total months, total profit/loss, average change, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits.

* Formatting and displaying the results to the terminal.

* Writing the analysis results to a text file using file I/O.
